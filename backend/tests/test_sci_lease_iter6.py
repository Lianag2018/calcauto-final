"""
Test Suite for CalcAuto AiPro - SCI Lease Calculation Features (Iteration 6)

Tests the corrected lease calculation logic:
1. Separate PDSF (MSRP) from selling price for residual calculation
2. Solde reporté field for carried-over balance
3. Tax credit on trade-in limited to total lease taxes
4. Fees automatically included
